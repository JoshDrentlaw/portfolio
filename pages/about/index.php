<h1>Soaking up the <span>California</span> sun and <span>mastering</span> web development</h1>

<div id="about-container">
    <p>I was born and raised in Southern California, and from a young age I've always been interested in computers. At
        first I just liked playing video games and I didn't understand much else, but over time I started learning more
        and more about how things worked. Then the internet started getting big and there was a whole new world of
        things to explore.</p>
    <p>My first taste of web development came in the Myspace days when editing your profile was a big thing. At that
        time I thought I wanted to get into digital art and Photoshop, but I was learning little bits of HTML and CSS
        while I was learning how to put these intricate layouts together. A Myspace layout was basically a bunch of
        tables so I got to see how HTML was structured, and what would happen if I put certain images in certain areas.
        I got to see how CSS could make the layout flow the way I needed or give areas a background color.
    </p>
    <p>It would be some time until I got back into any form of web development, but this time jQuery was the big thing.
        Myspace didn't allow JavaScript in your layout, so I was completely unfamiliar with JavaScript or scripting in
        general. I struggled with JavaScript a lot at first. I couldn't understand why looping was so important or what
        I would ever do with all this math? In time things started to click, and I started learning more advanced
        topics. Eventually I started branching out and learning frameworks like React or server side scripting with
        Node.js.</p>
    <p>The time came when I was finally ready to start applying for a web development job, and I was so scared. I had,
        and in some ways still struggle with imposter syndrome. I've always fealt like a smart person, but I got turned
        down for some more tech oriented positions in past jobs, so I didn't have a lot of confidence in myself at
        first. I kept at it though, and didn't let the voices in my head get me down. Within a few months of seriously
        applying, I had found my first job. I was so proud of myself, and still am.</p>
    <p>It's been a long road, and I still have a lot of road ahead of me, but I'm excited for every bit of it. Web
        development is a true passion of mine, and I hope as time goes on that I get to help as many people as possible
        with my skills and knowledge. Thank you for taking the time to get to know my a little bit, and I hope to hear
        from you in the near feature. Maybe we can change the world together.</p>
