Every freelancer has a first client, and I’m glad mine got to be a close friend. The first site I got to complete was for [Penny House Weddings](https://pennyhouseweddings.com "Penny House Weddings Home page"), the wedding videography branch of [King Media Co.](https://kingmediaco.com "King Media Co. Home page"), run by Adam King.
I’ve known Adam a long time, and I’ve seen him do some amazing things, but when he gets behind his camera, magic happens. Just ask any one of his clients. Penny House Weddings have a number of clients under their belt, and know what it takes to deliver the perfect video that captures all the amazing moments from your special day.
This site was very fun to build. I don’t fancy myself a real designer, so having a client like Adam that knows exactly what they want is kind of the dream. I just need to make sure I can deliver! Together we were able to work to create the perfect site for Adam, down to the smallest relevant details.
I’m looking forward to working with King Media Co. more in the future, and I hope some of you get the pleasure of meeting or getting to work with Adam.
