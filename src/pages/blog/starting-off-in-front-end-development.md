Hi, my name is Josh Drentlaw, and as a new freelance web developer, I wanted to talk about my journey a little bit.

I've been messing around with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for about 5 years, but didn't really take it seriously until about a year ago. I started off learning from my brother, who had gotten his start from one of our uncles. When I first started it was hard for me to figure out which things to learn, and I wasn't sure whether I even wanted to learn web development.

My brother was a little more into backend technologies, and I didn't really gravitate towards that aspect of programming early on. My uncle was out of the game at this point and mostly knew about Flash, so I didn't get guidance from him either unfortunately.

Using resources like [freecodecamp.org](http://freecodecamp.org), Medium articles, and other online resources, I was able to learn and understand a lot of concepts that were so mysterious and hard to understand at first. Having a list of projects to do that were designed to be within my skill range really helped as well. I can't tell you how many times I started a project only to realize after about a month or so of work that the project had some aspect that was way too complicated for me to tackle.

After completing a couple projects through freecodecamp, I started building more confidence. It felt really good to complete projects.

After I had a bit more understanding, I went back to some of my old projects and was able to push a little further, but I was still running into road blocks. I would learn more, and apply more to my projects, but it was never ending, and the levels of complexity were becoming too much me to handle by myself.

I started really noticing the lines between front-end and back-end development as I was learning more about writing servers, and dynamically rendering content, and managing sessions, and discovering that all of this is too much for just me.

Some people are sponges and can absorb and apply all this knowledge, but I unfortunately have my limits... With so many different areas of web development to focus on, sometimes you have to decide to specialize in some things and let other things go by the wayside for the time being. After some thought and reflection I decided that I wanted to stick with front-end development. I had focused much more of my attention on learning front-end technologies, it seemed like the natural path to take. Plus, I was learning that I still didn't like back-end stuff as much as front-end stuff.

I was a little stumped at how to proceed at this point though. If I just want to focus on the front-end, how will I manage all the things that happen in the back-end? My goal was to get into freelance work, and one thing almost every website needs is a contact form. How would I handle these forms?

Then I found Netlify. Netlify changed my life, because without it, I would've had to suck it up, and learn all the back-end stuff anyway. I'm not saying I want to totally neglect the back-end and never learn anything about it, I just don't want to maintain the technical knowledge needed to regularly work on the back-end.

If you don't know, Netlify is a hosting platform that makes deploying websites insanely easy. You can continuously deploy by connecting your site to Github, and any time you push changes to the master, or whichever branch you choose, your site is automatically rebuilt, and redeployed. Plus, and this is what really pulled me in at first: Netlify Forms. That's right, it handles forms. By adding a couple attributes to an existing form, you can make it detectable by the Netlify bots, and any submissions will be sent to your Netlify Forms dashboard.

After using Netlify for a while, I started realizing, maybe I should check out static site generators. There were a number to choose from, but Netlify seemed to be enthusiastic about GatsbyJS, so I decided to start there. And that's when the second punch of awesomeness slammed square into my face.

React is awesome, but learning Webpack can be tough, not to mention setting up React Router, and figuring out the best way to manage images, and lazy-loading content. Things were piling up again... But Gatsby changed everything again. I suddenly felt like, with these 2 tools, I could set out and confidently tell people that I could build a fully functioning website that would be easy to deploy and maintain.

It's been a long, fun road to get to this point, and as I attempt to start my journey as a freelance web developer I can't help but be a little nervous, but I'm also extremely excited.
