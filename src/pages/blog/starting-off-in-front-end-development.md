Hi, my name is Josh Drentlaw, and as a new freelance web developer, I wanted to talked about my journey a little bit.

I've been messing around with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for about 5 years, but didn't really take it seriously until about a year ago. I started off learning from my brother, who had gotten his start from one of our uncles. When I first started it was hard for me to figure out which things to learn, and I wasn't sure whether I even wanted to learn web development.

My brother was a little more into backend technologies, and I didn't really gravitate towards that aspect of programming early on. My uncle was out of the game at this point and mostly knew about Flash, so I didn't get guidance from him either unfortunately.

Using resources like freecodecamp.org, Medium articles, and other online resources, I was able to learn and understand a lot of concepts that were so mysterious and hard to understand at first.
